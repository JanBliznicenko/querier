# Querier

Querier is a prototype object-relational mapper developed in [Pharo](https://pharo.org) for Pharo 6+ applications. Its goal is to allow creating SQL queries using API similar to Pharo/smalltalk code - similarily to [Glorp](https://github.com/pharo-rdbms/glorp).

Note: I am not original author - just current maintainer. Code has been published with permission of the author.
